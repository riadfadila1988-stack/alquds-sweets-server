option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION: 'false'
    NODE_ENV: 'production'

# Notes:
# - Setting NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION to false ensures devDependencies (TypeScript, ts-node-dev, etc.)
#   are installed during deployment so the TypeScript build step can run (npx tsc).
# - This file is applied by Elastic Beanstalk during environment provisioning.
